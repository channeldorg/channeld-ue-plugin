REM description: refrenv = refresh environment. this is a better alternative to the chocolatey refreshenv for cmd
REM https://github.com/badrelmers/RefrEnv
REM https://stackoverflow.com/questions/171588/is-there-a-command-to-refresh-environment-variables-from-the-command-prompt-in-w

REM ___USAGE_____________________________________________________________
REM usage: 
REM        call refrenv.bat        full refresh. refresh all non critical variables*, and refresh the PATH

REM debug:
REM        to debug what this script do create this variable in your parent script like that
REM        set debugme=yes
REM        then the folder containing the files used to set the variables will be open. Then see
REM        _NewEnv.cmd this is the file which run inside your script to setup the new variables, you
REM        can also revise the intermediate files _NewEnv.cmd_temp_.cmd and _NewEnv.cmd_temp2_.cmd 
REM        (those two contains all the variables before removing the duplicates and the unwanted variables)


REM you can also put this script in windows\systems32 or another place in your %PATH% then call it from an interactive console by writing refrenv

REM *critical variables: are variables which belong to cmd/windows and should not be refreshed normally like:
REM - windows vars:
REM ALLUSERSPROFILE APPDATA CommonProgramFiles CommonProgramFiles(x86) CommonProgramW6432 COMPUTERNAME ComSpec HOMEDRIVE HOMEPATH LOCALAPPDATA LOGONSERVER NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS OS PATHEXT PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER PROCESSOR_LEVEL PROCESSOR_REVISION ProgramData ProgramFiles ProgramFiles(x86) ProgramW6432 PUBLIC SystemDrive SystemRoot TEMP TMP USERDOMAIN USERDOMAIN_ROAMINGPROFILE USERNAME USERPROFILE windir SESSIONNAME


REM ___INFO_____________________________________________________________
REM :: this script reload environment variables inside cmd every time you want environment changes to propagate, so you do not need to restart cmd after setting a new variable with setx or when installing new apps which add new variables ...etc


REM This is a better alternative to the chocolatey refreshenv for cmd, which solves a lot of problems like:

REM The Chocolatey refreshenv is so bad if the variable have some cmd meta-characters, see this test:
    REM add this to the path in HKCU\Environment: test & echo baaaaaaaaaad, and run the chocolatey refreshenv you will see that it prints baaaaaaaaaad which is very bad, and the new path is not added to your path variable.
    REM This script solve this and you can test it with any meta-character, even something so bad like:
    REM ; & % ' ( ) ~ + @ # $ { } [ ] , ` ! ^ | > < \ / " : ? * = . - _ & echo baaaad
    
REM refreshenv adds only system and user environment variables, but CMD adds volatile variables too (HKCU\Volatile Environment). This script will merge all the three and remove any duplicates.

REM refreshenv reset your PATH. This script append the new path to the old path of the parent script which called this script. It is better than overwriting the old path, otherwise it will delete any newly added path by the parent script.

REM This script solve this problem described in a comment by @Gene Mayevsky: refreshenv modifies env variables TEMP and TMP replacing them with values stored in HKCU\Environment. In my case I run the script to update env variables modified by Jenkins job on a slave that's running under SYSTEM account, so TEMP and TMP get substituted by %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp instead of C:\Windows\Temp. This breaks build because linker cannot open system profile's Temp folder.

REM ________
REM this script solve things like that too:
REM The confusing thing might be that there are a few places to start the cmd from. In my case I run cmd from windows explorer and the environment variables did not change while when starting cmd from the "run" (windows key + r) the environment variables were changed.

REM In my case I just had to kill the windows explorer process from the task manager and then restart it again from the task manager.
REM Once I did this I had access to the new environment variable from a cmd that was spawned from windows explorer.

REM my conclusion:
REM if I add a new variable with setx, i can access it in cmd only if i run cmd as admin, without admin right i have to restart explorer to see that new variable. but running this script inside my script (who sets the variable with setx) solve this problem and i do not have to restart explorer


REM ________
REM windows recreate the path using three places at less:
REM the User namespace:    HKCU\Environment
REM the System namespace:  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment
REM the Session namespace: HKCU\Volatile Environment
REM but the original chocolatey script did not add the volatile path. This script will merge all the three and remove any duplicates. this is what windows do by default too

REM there is this too which cmd seems to read when first running, but it contains only TEMP and TMP,so i will not use it
REM HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Environment


REM ___TESTING_____________________________________________________________
REM to test this script with extreme cases do
    REM :: Set a bad variable
    REM add a var in reg HKCU\Environment as the following, and see that echo is not executed.  if you use refreshenv of chocolatey you will see that echo is executed which is so bad!
    REM so save this in reg:
    REM all 32 characters: & % ' ( ) ~ + @ # $ { } [ ] ; , ` ! ^ | > < \ / " : ? * = . - _ & echo baaaad
    REM and this:
    REM (^.*)(Form Product=")([^"]*") FormType="[^"]*" FormID="([0-9][0-9]*)".*$
    REM and use set to print those variables and see if they are saved without change ; refreshenv fail dramatically with those variables
    
    
REM invalid characters (illegal characters in file names) in Windows using NTFS
REM \ / : * ? "  < > |  and ^ in FAT

REM this is a hybrid script which call vbs from cmd directly
REM :: The only restriction is the batch code cannot contain - - > (without space between - - > of course)
REM :: The only restriction is the VBS code cannot contain </script>.
REM :: The only risk is the undocumented use of "%~f0?.wsf" as the script to load. Somehow the parser properly finds and loads the running .BAT script "%~f0", and the ?.wsf suffix mysteriously instructs CSCRIPT to interpret the script as WSF. Hopefully MicroSoft will never disable that "feature".

REM detect if DelayedExpansion is enabled
REM It relies on the fact, that the last caret will be removed only in delayed mode.
REM https://www.dostips.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6496
set "DelayedExpansionState=IsDisabled"
IF "^!" == "^!^" (
    REM echo DelayedExpansion is enabled
    set "DelayedExpansionState=IsEnabled"
)


REM :: generate %outputfile% which contain all the new variables
REM cscript //nologo "%~f0?.wsf" %1
cscript //nologo "%~f0?.wsf" "%outputfile%" %DelayedExpansionState%


REM ::set the new variables generated with vbscript script above
REM for this to work always it is necessary to use DisableDelayedExpansion or escape ! and ^ when using EnableDelayedExpansion, but this script already solve this, so no worry about that now, thanks to God
REM test it with some bad var like:
REM all 32 characters: ; & % ' ( ) ~ + @ # $ { } [ ] , ` ! ^ | > < \ / " : ? * = . - _ & echo baaaad
REM For /f delims^=^ eol^= %%a in (%outputfile%) do %%a
REM for /f "delims== tokens=1,2" %%G in (%outputfile%) do set "%%G=%%H"
For /f delims^=^ eol^= %%a in (%outputfile%) do set %%a


REM for safely print a variable with bad charachters do:
REM SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion
REM echo "!z9!"
REM or
REM set z9
REM but generally paths and environment variables should not have bad metacharacters, but it is not a rule!


if "%debugme%"=="yes" (
    explorer "%TEMPDir%"
) else (
    rmdir /Q /S "%TEMPDir%"
)

REM cleanup
set "TEMPDir="
set "outputfile="

REM and it is faster as stated by this comment
REM While I prefer the Chocolatey code-wise for being pure batch code, overall I decided to use this one, since it's faster. (~0.3 seconds instead of ~1 second -- which is nice, since I use it frequently in my Explorer "start cmd here" entry) – 

REM and it is safer based on my tests, the Chocolatey refreshenv is so bad if the variable have some cmd metacharacters

for each sitem in oEnvV
    tmpF.WriteLine(sitem)
next

set oEnvP=WshShell.Environment("Process")
REM i will not save the process env but only its path, because it have strange variables like  =::=::\ and  =F:=.... which seems to be added by vbscript
REM for each sitem in oEnvP
    REM tmpF.WriteLine(sitem)
REM next
REM here we add the actual session path, so we do not reset the original path, because maybe the parent script added some folders to the path, If we need to reset the path then comment the following line
ProcessPath = oEnvP("PATH")

REM merge System, User, Volatile, and process PATHs
NewPath = SystemPath & ";" & UserPath & ";" & VolatilePath & ";" & ProcessPath


REM ________________________________________________________________
REM :: remove duplicates from path
REM :: expand variables so they become like windows do when he read reg and create path, then Remove duplicates without sorting 
    REM why i will clean the path from duplicates? because:
    REM the maximum string length in cmd is 8191 characters. But string length doesnt mean that you can save 8191 characters in a variable because also the assignment belongs to the string. you can save 8189 characters because the remaining 2 characters are needed for "a="
   
    REM based on my tests: 
    REM when i open cmd as user , windows does not remove any duplicates from the path, and merge system+user+volatil path
    REM when i open cmd as admin, windows do: system+user path (here windows do not remove duplicates which is stupid!) , then it adds volatil path after removing from it any duplicates 

REM ' https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Remove_duplicate_elements#VBScript

REM :: exclude setting variables which may be dangerous to change

    REM when i run a script from task scheduler using SYSTEM user the following variables are the differences between the scheduler env and a normal cmd script, so i will not override those variables

    REM USERNAME=LLED2
    REM USERNAME=LLED2-PC$

    REM USERPROFILE=D:\Users\LLED2
    REM USERPROFILE=D:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile

    REM i know this thanks to this comment
    REM The solution is good but it modifies env variables TEMP and TMP replacing them with values stored in HKCU\Environment. In my case I run the script to update env variables modified by Jenkins job on a slave that's running under SYSTEM account, so TEMP and TMP get substituted by %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp instead of C:\Windows\Temp.
